**Overview**

This class is meant to be an overview of using Python Pandas for those who have never used it before, or who have made some progress but could use further guidance. Some background in working with tabular data is helpful, but not required. We'll focus on the following goals:

 - Understand the building blocks of a Pandas dataframe
 - Know how to make a dataframe and how to load it with data
 - Filtering, selecting, and other common operations needed to focus on a subset of a dataframe
 - Updating values
 - Table joins and merges
 - Exporting a dataframe to a saved file

**Materials**

We will work from this Jupyter Notebook, available on our course JupyterHub instance here: https://tutorials-1.rcnyu.org.

You are welcome to download and deploy this same Notebook in your own local Jupyter environment. To copy the entire set of teaching materials, clone its repository:
